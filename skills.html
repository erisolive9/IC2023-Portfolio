                <figcaption>I began learning HTML online in the fall of my freshman year (2021) after becoming
                            interested in computer science. I got help from my school's Girls Who Code club
                            and various free educational websites at the start, then went on to the Catapult 
                            program and advanced my skills much more with Nextech's lessons.

                <figcaption>I learned CSS simultaneously with HTML when first learning. However, my skills were
                            very limited to changing the colors, fonts, and sizes of elements in my websites.
                            Once I went to Nextech, they instructed us more on the design process and more advanced
                            components of CSS, and my websites began to look more professional.

                <figcaption>During my freshman year, I learned how to code in block JavaScript through code.org's
                            AP Computer Science Principles curriculum <a href="https://code.org/educate/csp"
                            target="_blank" class="learnMore">?</a> at school. This taught me very basic 
                            fundamentals of programming, then at Catapult I went on to learn some JS that's 
                            applicable to web development.

            <p class="horizontalCaption">For my sophomore year, I took AP Computer Science A (again using code.org
                <a href="https://code.org/educate/csa" target="_blank" class="learnMore">?</a>) at school and 
                learned how to program in Java. During this course, I made many projects that utilized <abbr>NLP</abbr>
                (Natural Language Processing) to combine my interests in CS and linguistics. 
                We also utilized datasets and documentation to create projects.

                <figcaption>I have had Github for about a year or two, but finally learned how to use it
                            properly from Nextech. Now, I put all of the projects I do on repositories
                            in Github so they're all saved in an accessible spot. I also know how to source 
                            other creator's code from Github.

                            it for over a year. I use it to manage multiple projects with HTML, CSS, and JS files
                            and utilize multiple extensions that make the IDE even more helpful.

                            and industry professionals that I've seen through Nextech. I've been exploring it 
                            recently to try out designs for my websites and experiment with designing in general.

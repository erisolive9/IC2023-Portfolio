                <figcaption>I began learning HTML online in the fall of my freshman year (2021) after becoming
                            interested in computer science. I got help from my school's Girls Who Code club
                            and various free educational websites at the start, then went on to the Catapult 
                            program and advanced my skills much more with Nextech's lessons.

                <figcaption>I learned CSS simultaneously with HTML when first learning. However, my skills were
                            very limited to changing the colors, fonts, and sizes of elements in my websites.
                            Once I went to Nextech, they instructed us more on the design process and more advanced
                            components of CSS, and my websites began to look more professional.

                <figcaption>During my freshman year, I learned how to code in block JavaScript through code.org's
                            AP Computer Science Principles curriculum <a href="https://code.org/educate/csp"
                            target="_blank" class="learnMore">?</a> at school. This taught me very basic 
                            fundamentals of programming, then at Catapult I went on to learn some JS that's 
                            applicable to web development.

                <a href="https://code.org/educate/csa" target="_blank" class="learnMore">?</a>) at school and 
                learned how to program in Java. During this course, I made many projects that utilized <abbr>NLP</abbr>
                (Natural Language Processing) to combine my interests in CS and linguistics. 
                We also utilized datasets and documentation to create projects.

                            properly from Nextech. Now, I put all of the projects I do on repositories
                            in Github so they're all saved in an accessible spot. I also know how to source 
                            other creator's code from Github.

                            and utilize multiple extensions that make the IDE even more helpful.

                            and industry professionals that I've seen through Nextech. I've been exploring it 
                            recently to try out designs for my websites and experiment with designing in general.

                club accounts, and I design our posts in Canva. I also recently made the decision to 
                include Spanish versions of our information in the posts to accomodate for the Spanish-speaking 
                parents and students in Speedway. I also help manage my small business's page with a friend,

                <figcaption>I started crocheting in the fall of 2021 for my Innovations class and I made over a dozen
                            hats and scarves ended up donating them to my school's food and clothing pantry that the 
                            Key Club manages, called Sparky's Closet. I then established a small business with one of 
                            my best friends selling the products we made. You can read more about this project, called
                            PrideVerse, in the Projects page!

                <figcaption>Knitting is more new to me. Within the past year, I had tried it multiple times but couldn't 
                            quite figure it out until I got help from a friend. I only know how to do very basic stitches
                            and patterns, and I prefer crocheting most of the time because I feel like it allows more 
                            creative freedom. Soon, I would love to knit a sweater for myself, but so far I've only made 
                            a small drawstring bag that someone commissioned me for and a tapestry.

                <figcaption>I've dabbled in a bit of embroidery especially since some crochet projects require
                            sewing or embroidering an applique onto a piece. So far I've just used a small kit that 
                            I received as a gift, and I made this small bee pattern on the back of a pair of jean 
                            shorts. I definitely want to learn how to get better at embroidery in the future!
